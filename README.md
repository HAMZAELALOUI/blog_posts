# Next.js Blog Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Project Overview

This project is a blog application where users can add, edit, and delete blog posts. It also supports image uploads for each blog post. The project uses Axios for making HTTP requests and MongoDB as the database.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Features

- Add new blog posts with image uploads
- Edit existing blog posts
- Delete blog posts
- View all blog posts
- Responsive design

## Axios and MongoDB Integration

This project uses Axios for making HTTP requests and MongoDB for the database.

### Setting Up MongoDB

1. **Install MongoDB**: Follow the instructions on the [MongoDB installation page](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) to install MongoDB on your machine.
2. **Start MongoDB**: Once installed, start the MongoDB server by running:
   ```bash
   mongod
   ```
3. **Create a Database**: Connect to your MongoDB server and create a new database for your project.
   ```bash
   mongo
   use mydatabase
   ```
4. **Set Up Environment Variables**: Add your MongoDB connection string to your `.env.local` file.
   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase
   ```

### Using Axios

Axios is used for making HTTP requests to your API routes or external APIs.

1. **Install Axios**: Add Axios to your project by running:
   ```bash
   npm install axios
   ```
2. **Make a Request**: Use Axios in your components or API routes to make HTTP requests.
   ```javascript
   import axios from 'axios';

   const fetchData = async () => {
     const response = await axios.get('/api/posts');
     console.log(response.data);
   };
   ```
